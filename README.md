# AdoptedStorageAccess

Warning: Use at your own risk! You can create files and folders that you may not be able to open or delete later.*

Lets you access a folder on your adopted storage using a file manager (tested with ES File Explorer). After installing move it to the adopted SD card. 

*Files and folders created with one app can be opened later with that same app but other apps may not be able to access those files and folders.
